Angular helps developers and programmers build and maintain complex applications. The popular, widely used JavaScript platform gives you a solid foundation of web-based functionality, letting you take care of the design and implementation details as you go.

In this course, instructor Derek Peruo introduces you to the essentials of this incredible platform, including some of its most powerful features such as comprehensive routing and navigation, dependency injection, and much more. Derek steps through Angular one feature at a time, focusing on the component-based architecture of the entire platform. Learn what Angular is, what it can do, how to configure it, how to troubleshoot common problems, and how to get up and running building a full-featured web app, following detailed instructions from start to finish. Upon completing this course, youâ€™ll be ready to tackle other project-based courses in the LinkedIn Learning library and create your own customized Angular application.

## Instructions
This repository contains two folders for the contents of the course:
- *Finished*: The fully finished versions of the code examples. Intended to be used as a reference and for help with troubleshooting your own code
- *Start*: The starting point for each exercise. This is the code that you will use in the course to build towards the finished examples.

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files locally on your computer, you must have the following installed:
	- .NET SDK, version 7
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. We suggest using Visual Studio Code as your editor, but any text editor will work

## Codespace
This course has been set up to use Codespaces, an online development environment that requires no installation. Fork a copy of the repository in your own Github account and use a Codespace to work entirely online.
